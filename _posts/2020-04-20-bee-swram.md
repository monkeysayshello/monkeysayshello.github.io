My name is monkyesayshello so i hope you like this.so i will be talking about bee swarm simulator so basic thing is about to hatch bees from eggs(you start with one) use them to make pollen and you if your lucky you can get a treat that are use to level up your bees you can get five different eggs.

I will list them from worst to best basic,silver,gold,dimond and mythic.different bees have different abilites.each abilite can be access by collecting its abilites tokens.there are seven zones.i will call them by what bee is on the gate.basic bee gate,brave bee gate,honey bee gate,ant gate,lion bee gate,bear gate,and windy bee gate.

Bears could give quests a quest reward can give honey,items or tearts.ohter bears that dont give guest(shadow bear) can be guarding things like shadow bear guards a dimond egg under where onet stands(onet is the creator).btw bears are not the only things that can give quest :).ok so things that arent bears but give quest are bees.

Bucko bee in the blue hq can only be acseable if it is given one translator(translators are given by science bear) and so as riley bee that is found in the red hq.ok before i tell you how you can gain access to both hqs are that there is five type a bees and three different kinds of bees(red,blue and none).so you need to discover four blue bees to enter the blue hq.in the blue hq there is a shop,a blueberry dispenser,a blue feild booster(five blue bees must be discovered for access),a royale jelly and a blue portal.

I will talk about royale jelly after i explain the red hq.in the red hq there is a shop,a red feild booster(access able after five RED bees are DISCOVERED),a red portal,a straw berry dispenser,a royale jelly and riley bee(only access able if ONE TRANSLATOR is given).so royale jelly is like a potion that can transform your bee into another bee.the more common a bee is that bee is more likely to be the output of the royale jelly.

There are more treats such as blue berries,straw berries,pineapple,sun flower seeds,bitter berries,ratioactive treat,etc.so any ways now i will tell you jow much legendary bees are there,mythic bees,rare bees,epic bees, and common bees. there are forty two bees.three of them are mytihc,eight of them are lengdary bees,eleven of the are are epic bees,one of them are common, and nine teen of them are rare.baised on what i know commons bees are the worst and mythic bees are the best.so i will list them from worst to greatest.common,rare,epic,lengdary and finally mythic.
