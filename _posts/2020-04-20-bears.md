Panda bear is the bear who likes to fight like kungfu panda!
He gives you quest that all include fighting mobs such as rhino
beetles,lady bugs,mantis,werewolfs,scorpian,spider,aphids and
ants(unlocked when 20 bees are hatched.

Bee bear is a bear that only comes in about december to febuary.
he is like a christmas bear or "beesmas bear"he and polar bear were
great buddies!His name is actually festibe bear but you can call
him bee bear.

![black-bear]({{site.baseurl}}/images/black-bear.png)

Black bear is the bear who is like the king of
the bears.So he is probally the first bear you
want to visit because he is probally the best
of the bears(to me)

![polar-bear]({{site.baseurl}}/images/polar-bear.png)

As i said polar bear is a good friend of bee
bear or beesmas bear or festive bear.Polar bear
is the bear who likes to cook his quest are just
in a pattern so if you do a quest remeber in some
time it will come back!


![shadow-bear]({{site.baseurl}}/images/shadow-bear.png)

shadow bear is not a quest bear he is just some
dancing staue but the thing that makes me mention
him is that there is a dimond egg in front of him.
so its hard to get there but if you did good job.
well if you hit the ground you die and if you
have a glider its so fast and big so its hard
to see so the best thing to do is use a pharachute
because its slower and smaller.

gummy bear is like shadow bear but he is flying.
he is in a lair.in order to go there you need gummy
badge hot shot.after that jump on the gummy bee that
is over the gummy bee egg claim.then it will ask for 
gum drops.you have to use gumdrops then after like 
three times it will warp you to there lair.
